    <h2>Headings</h2>
    <p>
      HTML defines six levels of headings. A heading element implies all the
      font changes, paragraph breaks before and after, and any white space
      necessary to render the heading. The heading elements are H1, H2, H3, H4,
      H5, and H6 with H1 being the highest (or most important) level and H6 the
      least.

      Headings Are Important Users often skim a page by its headings. It is
      important to use headings to show the document structure. &lt;h1&gt;
      headings should be used for main headings, followed by &lt;h2&gt;
      headings, then the less important &lt;h3&gt; , and so on. Note: Use HTML
      headings for headings only.
