    <h2>Paragraphs</h2>
    <p>
      The HTML &lt;p&gt; element represents a paragraph. Paragraphs are usually
      represented in visual media as blocks of text separated from adjacent
      blocks by blank lines and/or first-line indentation, but HTML paragraphs
      can be any structural grouping of related content, such as images or form
      fields.
    </p>

    <p>
      The &lt;p&gt; tag in HTML defines a paragraph. These have both opening and
      closing tag. So anything mentioned within &lt;p&gt; and &lt;/p&gt; is
      treated as a paragraph. Most browsers read a line as a paragraph even if
      we don't use the closing tag i.e, &lt;/p&gt;, but this may raise
      unexpected results.
